## :smirk_cat: Why do you need Hex.VM ? 

Hex.VM was built so that people can learn from it, for real-world use, other obfuscation techniques such as mutations, controlflow, and renamer would bring this VM to its full potential.
<br><br>

## :star: How does it work ?

- MSIL to VMIL
- Methods are stored as resources
- Bytes are encrypted with a simple xor cipher 
<br>

## :fire: What does it do ?

- [x] Virtualizes methods into instructions, which only Hex.VM can understand
- [x] Has support for a decent amount of opcodes, as said, this is made for educational purposes, and as such, I believe these opcodes are enough for people to build on
- [x] Easy to use, understand, and build on
